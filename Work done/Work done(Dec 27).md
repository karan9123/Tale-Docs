**Database Creation and Setup**

- Created a local copy of tale database with a subset of all tables to test for USER CRUD operations and Link Read operations.
- GraphQL APIs written to fetch relations as per Zhang's design after working on a TIER design plan.

**Postgres Server Setup**

- Set up Postgres database locally to test for queries.

**Implementing CRUD Operations using GraphQL**

- User CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations were tested with GraphQL.

**Migration to AWS**

- Migrated a local copy of database to my AWS instance to test for connection issues and how the database responds to the queries.

**Database Design and Redesign**

- Worked on database redesign by making some changes to existing tables.

**Shifting to Tale AWS**

- Modified the queries and endpoints in the existing code base to reflect the similarities of the taledb.

**Next step:**

- AWS CLI access to start testing the code interaction with tale db.
