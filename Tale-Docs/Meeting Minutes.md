### Minutes of the Meeting on [Nov 17, 23]

**Main Points Discussed:**

1. **Limit on Displayed Users:**
   - It was agreed that at any given time, the maximum number of users displayed on the page should not exceed 50. This limit includes any scaling or zooming adjustments.

2. **Tier 1 Connection Display Rules:**
   - Tier 1 connection cards will be displayed close to the central user card. This proximity will serve as an indicator of their Tier 1 status.
   - The visual representation of Tier 1 connection cards should be slightly smaller than the central user's card.
   - Special Rule for Tier 1 Connections:
     - If a Tier 1 connection has more than 3 users as their own Tier 1 connections (including the current user), this connection will be distinguished with a line.
     - Up to 3 of these additional Tier 1 connections will be shown in smaller size near the primary Tier 1 connection.
     - Tier 1 connections with less than 3 own Tier 1 connections will be displayed without additional lines or connections.

3. **Tier 2 Connection Display Rules:**
   - Tier 2 connections will be displayed only if the total number of Tier 1 users and their connections do not fill the 50-user quota.
   - These connections should be positioned farther from the central card, in a different direction, forming their own cluster.
   - Tier 2 connections will follow the same display rules as Tier 1 for their own connections.

4. **Tier 3 Connections:**
   - Tier 3 connections will be handled similarly, displayed in a way that follows the same principles as Tier 1 and Tier 2.

**Next Steps:**
- Karan will incorporate these guidelines into the user connections visualization algorithm.
- We will meet around Wednesday to discuss further.

**Additional Notes:**
- There was a consensus on the importance of maintaining a clear and intuitive user interface, especially when handling a large number of connections.
