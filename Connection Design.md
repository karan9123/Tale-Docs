**User Table:**

- Contains basic information about each user.
	- `user_id`: The unique identifier for each user.
	- `name`: The full name of the user.
	- `birthdate`: The birth date of the user to help calculate generational level.
	- `additional_fields`: Other personal details as required (e.g., address, contact information, etc.).

**Relations Table:**

- Stores pairs of users and their direct relationships.
	- `relation_id`: The unique identifier for each relationship entry.
	- `user_id1`: The user ID of the first user in the relationship.
	- `user_id2`: The user ID of the second user in the relationship, who is related to the first user.
	- `relationship_name`: The name of the relationship from the perspective of the first user toward the second user (e.g., 'father', 'mother', 'brother').
	- `relationship_type_id`: An identifier that links to the relationship types table to categorize the relationship

**Relationship Names Table:**

- Stores relationship names, categorized by generational level.
	-  `relationship_type_id`: The unique identifier for each type of relationship.
	- `generation_level`: A numeric or symbolic identifier that represents the generational level (e.g., 0 for the user's generation, -1 for parents, 1 for children, etc.).
	- `relationship_names`: An array or list of relationship names associated with this generational level.





**Scalability Considerations:**

1. **Many-to-Many Relationships:** Since a user can have multiple relationships, and each relationship can be shared by multiple users, we can support many-to-many relationships.
2. **Caching Generational Data:** If the generational data doesn't change frequently, it could be cached to speed up queries that need to resolve relationships by generation.
3. **Sharding:** Database can be sharded regularly based on undirected/unlinked users.
